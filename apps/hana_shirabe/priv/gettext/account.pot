## "msgid"s here are often extracted from source code.
## Add new messages manually only if they're dynamic
## messages that can't be statically extracted.

## Run "mix gettext.extract" to bring this file up to
## date. Leave "msgstr"s empty as changing them here has no
## effect: edit them in PO (.po) files instead.
