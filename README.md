# Echoes Under Blossoms

[简体中文](./README.zh_Hans.md) | [日本語](./README.ja.md)

This project is not just another forum or wiki. We are building a **Digital Archaeology Professional Team** and a **Living Archive**. Our mission is to establish a sustainable, traceable, and trustworthy system for the discovery and preservation of digital media that has been lost or buried in the torrent of the internet.

## Our Quest

Our inspiration comes from the work of pioneers like [埋埋埋埋喵](https://space.bilibili.com/3494356619102794). They have recovered countless precious lost musical pieces through personal passion and perseverance. However, we also recognize that contemporary lost media investigations are often mired in a sea of fragmented information. Clues are scattered across ephemeral chat groups, forum posts, and personal memories. The investigation process is chaotic and untraceable, and valuable discoveries struggle to become part of public knowledge. Sometimes, these discoveries are lost again when these heroes move on.

Individual efforts are commendable, but we strive for a more robust paradigm. We need an engine that can channel the sparks of individual insight into the flame of collective wisdom.

## Our Solution: Separating Process from Results

Chaos is the nature of investigation, while clarity is the form of knowledge. We don't try to eliminate chaos; we harness it. The core design of our project is to completely separate the investigation process from the final conclusions.

### The Investigation Map

This is our **Process Workbench**, a non-linear collaborative space that embraces contradictions, hypotheses, and vast amounts of intelligence. All information, no matter how trivial or seemingly contradictory, is gathered here first. Community members use an **"Evidence Weighting"** mechanism to collectively verify, supplement, and challenge clues. Based on the strength of community consensus, the system automatically surfaces key clues and their relationships as a dynamic **Dependency Graph**. The role of the proposal's lead is no longer that of a judge, but one or more chief curators responsible for interpreting this star chart drawn by collective intelligence.

### The Main Timeline

This is our **Results Showcase**, a public knowledge archive that presents a clear, linear narrative. When the evidence chains in the Investigation Map form a sufficiently stable consensus, the lead will author the **Main Timeline** of the media's discovery journey. Each node on the timeline corresponds strictly to a set of evidence from the Investigation Map. This relationship is transparent and traceable, providing a solid foundation for future questioning, revision, and iteration of knowledge.

### The Living Archive

Archiving is not the end. Any archived conclusion is merely a **"Stable Snapshot"**. When new, disruptive evidence emerges, the archive is immediately **"reactivated"** to begin a new investigation cycle. The system will use the Dependency Graph to automatically flag old conclusions whose foundations have been shaken, issuing a **"Stability Alert"** to all followers. Here, knowledge is in a perpetual state of dynamic growth and self-correction.

## An Invitation to Co-Creators

We are looking not just for code contributors, but for **co-creators** of this ambitious project.

-   If you are a **developer**, you will have the opportunity to build an unprecedented knowledge-conversion engine, solving core challenges in community collaboration.
-   If you are a **researcher** or **lost media enthusiast**, you will get a professional toolkit to turn your every excavation into a solid and credible piece of public heritage.
-   If you are a **storyteller**, you will have the chance to transform complex investigation processes into compelling narratives, helping more people understand the charm of digital archaeology.

This is a challenging field, but we believe that through structured collaboration, individual passion will ultimately converge into a torch of civilization.
